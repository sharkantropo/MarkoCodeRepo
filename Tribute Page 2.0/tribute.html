            <p id="big-paragraph"><i>Ultima</i> is a serie of Open World Rpgs developed by Richard Garriott. Many innovations
                of the early Ultimas – in particular <i>Ultima III: Exodus</i> (1983) onward– eventually became standard
                among the RPG genre, such as the use of tiled graphics and party-based combat, its mix of fantasy and science-fiction
                elements, and the introduction of time travel as a plot device. In turn, some of these elements were inspired
                by Wizardry, specifically the party-based combat. <i>Exodus</i> was also revolutionary in its use of a written
                narrative to convey a larger story than the typically minimal plots that were common at the time; also, <i>Quest
                    of the Avatar</i> deconstructs the typical narrative about vanquishing a major evil by setting the player
                in a quest to reach an state of enlightenment known as "Avatar of virtues", which is reached after solving
                a series of puzzles and reading a book deep within an ominous place called the Stygian Abyss.</p>
